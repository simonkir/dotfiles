This is my i3 config directory in `~/.i3/`

# Dependencies
* `zsh` for `create_config`

## Optional Dependencies
* [`numlockx (community)`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/numlockx/) to enable the numlock on startup
* [`ulauncher (AUR)`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ulauncher/) to have a better application launcher
* [`redshift (community)`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/redshift/) tints the screen amber in the evening
* `nitrogen` for the wallpaper. See 'Tips & Tricks' for more information!
* `setxkbmap` to remap caps lock to escape

# Note on Installing
On some systems, the i3 config isn't located at `~/.i3/` but at `~/.config/i3/`.

In that case, I suggest symlinking `~/.i3/` to `~/.config/i3/`.

# Usage
All config files go into `config.d/` or a corresponding directory, e.g. `keybinds/`.

Run `create_config` to apply your changes. The script deletes your old `config` and a new one from all the files specified in `config.d/i3_configs.conf`.

# Tips & Tricks
## Keybinds
I changed the `j/k/l/;` keybinds to `h/j/k/l`, to be more compatible with vim. Opening a horizintal split is possible with `$mod+Shift+v`.

## Screen Layouts
The config file automatically loads a script which takes care of the screen layouting and settings, located in `~/.i3/resources/screenlayout.sh`. All screen layout specific commands go into this file.

If you don't have more than one screen, just don't create the `screenlayout.sh` file or leave it empty.

**Suggestion:** Use [`arandr (community)`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/arandr/) to do the screen layouting, save the output to the `screenlayout.sh` (see Dependencies for install instructions).
