# Install i3-config
Back up your `~/.i3/` directory, e.g. by moving it to your desktop.
If not already done, delete your `~/.i3/` directory.
Clone this repo into your home folder `~`
Rename the `~/i3-config/` directory to `~/.i3/`
Restart your device for the changes to take effect.

# Usage
All config files go into `config.d/` or a corresponding directory, e.g. `keybinds/`.

If you want to add something to the config, change an existing or create a new `*.conf` file in `config.d/`.
<br>
After you created a new config file, you need to `import <filename>` your file into `config.d/i3_configs.conf`.

Run `create_config` to apply your changes.
<br>
The script basically deletes your old `config` and creates one big config file from all your files from `config.d/`.

# Tips & Tricks
## Keybinds
I changed the `j/k/l/;` keybinds to `h/j/k/l`, to be more compatible with vim.
<br>
Opening a horizintal split is possible with `$mod+Shift+v`.

## Wallpapers
The config restores the last used wallpaper by nitrogen on startup.

**Suggestion:** Configure your wallpapers using `nitrogen`.

### Lockscreen wallpaper
The lockscreen wallpaper is located in `~/.i3/resources/lockscreen.png`.

**Note:** The wallpaper and lockscreen have to be a `.png` image, otherwise they won't be loaded correctly.

**Suggestion:** Put all your wallpapers into a directory, e.g. `~/Pictures/` and link your favorite wallpaper to `~/.i3/resources/wallpaper.png`.

## Wallpaper widgets
The wallpaper widgets are located in `~/.conky/`. The conky script executed on system start is `~/.conky/conky-startup.sh`.

**Suggestion:** Use [`conky-manager`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/conky-manager/) to do the layouting. But if doing so, don't forget to make the above script executable.

## Bar
The status bar command is i3blocks. The i3blocks config is located in `config.d/i3blocks.conf`.

## Screen Layouts
The config file automatically loads a script which takes care of the screen layouting and settings, located in `~/.i3/resources/screenlayout.sh`. All screen layout specific commands go into this file.
<br>
If you don't have more than one screen, just don't create the `screenlayout.sh` file or leave it empty.

**Suggestion:** Use `arandr` to do the screen layouting, save the output to the `screenlayout.sh` (see Dependencies for install instructions).
