This is my i3 config directory in `~/.i3/`

# Note on Installing
On some systems, the i3 config isn't located at `~/.i3/` but at `~/.config/i3/`.

In that case, I suggest symlinking `~/.i3/` to `~/.config/i3/`.

# Usage
All config files go into `config.d/` or a corresponding directory, e.g. `keybinds/`.

Run `create_config` to apply your changes. The script deletes your old `config` and a new one from all the files specified in `config.d/i3_configs.conf`.
